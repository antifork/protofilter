.: PROTOFILTER :. $Id$

OVERVIEW
--------

 Protofilter is a linux kernel 2.2.x family patch. It adds the feature of 
packet filtering, concerning the idle option goal. This feature allows the 
correct operation of the ppp idle option; it is important when you need 
ppp-on-demand.

  By adding the feature of filtering (active filters  are currently implemented 
under netBSD)  you  can easily specify a list of protocol the ppp will ignore
when it computes the idle time. 

  Some isp' sends broadcast igmp (protocol =2), others sends proto-103 (carrier
control packages); the effect is that your  ppp isn't able to  close the connec-
tion in the manner required, since it's not able to calculate the idle time in 
the correct way.
 
  You just need to sniff your ppp connection when there is no traffic, 
to determine which packets you need to ignore like.

example:
# tcpdump -i ppp0
10:33:56.438456 151.5.148.59 > 224.0.0.1: igmp query [tos 0xc0] [ttl 1]
10:34:06.378454 151.5.148.59 > 224.0.0.13: ip-proto-103 10 [tos 0xc0] [ttl 1]
10:34:36.548456 151.5.148.59 > 224.0.0.13: ip-proto-103 10 [tos 0xc0] [ttl 1]
10:34:56.798451 151.5.148.59 > 224.0.0.1: igmp query [tos 0xc0] [ttl 1]
10:35:06.858442 151.5.148.59 > 224.0.0.13: ip-proto-103 10 [tos 0xc0] [ttl 1]

Now load the ppp module patched, specifying the protocol marked as 
being ignored:

modprobe ppp proto_in=2,103            

note: 2=igmp protocol, see /etc/protocols


INSTALL
-------
To install the patch, set your uid to root and type ./proto.sh install.
If everything goes fine, change directory to /usr/src/linux and rebuild the 
modules.

make modules
make modules_install
